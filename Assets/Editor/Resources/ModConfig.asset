  title: Top 10 Numbers
  author: Cooldoom5
  description: Hey everyone, it's time for another "Top 10", and this week we're kicking
    it old-school, with a classic that is backkick, top 10 numbers from 1 through
    10! Starting us off at number 10, it's number 7! At number 9, it's number 8! And
    at number 7, it's number 9, but look out 7, at number 6, it's number 4. Quick
    recap, because number 9 was number 8, but you'll need to know the context for
    this next number, because it's number 5, for number 4! And at number 4, it's number
    2, but number 3 this week is also number 5! That's right folks, there are two
    number 5s, a number 6, and number 3. In your face number 3, you didn't even make
    the top 10! And at number 2, it's number 1. So close 1, but there can only be
    one number 1, and that one number at number 1 is number 5! Heck you number 1 and
    3, your numbers are garbage!
